# HXRD_Release
This program is only for Windows OS.
You only need to download all the files (maybe as a zip file) and copy/unzip them in a folder in your computer. 
Then go to the folder and click the "HXRD.exe" file to run. No installation necessary.
Keep the sub-folder "f0f1f2" directly under the main folder (just don't change anything about this subfolder).
